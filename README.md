# Sellar
I've been exploring Astro lately, and I wondered: what better way to learn than by creating a chatroom service in Astro powered by a Golang backend! Stellar is still a work in progress, but I've had a lot of fun developing it. I'll continue working on it and plan to add more features<br>
Some of the current features are:
- ⚡️ Super fast websocket connection powered by a Go backend with minimum dependencies
- 🐘 Uses Postgres
- 💬 5 independent chatrooms where "astronauts"(Stellar users are called astronauts btw) can chat with each other
- 😎 Interactive and Cool UI
(Don't ask me about these emojis.. they looked cool :))

Stellar lacks quite a lot of features, like:
- Proper authentication. I just whipped up something really quick.
- Rate limiting
- I wasn't able to host the Go backend on a free service. I tried to host it on AWS, but the frontend is hosted on vercel and vercel doesn't allow http requests
- It has no support for binary files and most importantly, emojis 😭

I'll be enhancing the project and refactoring all the garbage code I wrote in just 2 days<br>
Coming up with a good UI design is really challenging; it's the aspect where I struggled the most :')

Anyway, here are some screenshots depicting how Stellar **works on my machine!**
